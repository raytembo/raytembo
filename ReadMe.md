# üëã Hi, I'm Ray

I'm a passionate full-stack developer, creative UI/UX designer, and the founder of [Cichlify](https://github.com/cichlify) ‚Äî a forward-thinking organization dedicated to building user-centered, impactful digital products. With a strong foundation in both code and design, I work at the intersection of technology and creativity to craft seamless experiences for web and mobile platforms.

As a developer, I specialize in building robust, scalable applications using technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, Flutter, React, Next.js, and Node.js. I have hands-on experience with a range of back-end systems, databases like Firebase, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, and development tools like Docker, GitHub Actions, and Supabase. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean code, well-structured architecture, and agile development practices.

In parallel, my background in UI/UX design allows me to create thoughtful, intuitive interfaces that elevate the user experience. I use tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and Illustrator to prototype and refine visuals that blend form with function. Accessibility, brand consistency, and usability are at the core of every design decision I make.

Beyond individual projects, I lead Cichlify ‚Äî a creative tech organization where innovation and impact meet. At Cichlify, I oversee the development of tools and platforms aimed at solving challenges across business, culture, and everyday life. Projects like **Tech Nest** (an e-commerce platform), **Whispers from the Soul** (a poetry-sharing app), **JobLink** (a job connection tool), and a **POS & IP billing system** are some of the products we've built to empower users and organizations alike.

My approach is driven by a clear philosophy: great technology should feel natural, and great design should get out of the user's way. I strive to build systems that are not only technically sound but also beautiful and meaningful to the people who use them.

If you're interested in working together, collaborating, or just sharing ideas, feel free to reach out. I‚Äôm always open to new opportunities and meaningful conversations.

Thanks for stopping by my profile ‚Äî and welcome to my world of clean code, purposeful design, and community-focused tech.
