# 👋 Hi, I'm Ray  
**Developer • Designer • Problem Solver • Founder @ [Cichlify](https://github.com/cichlify-official)**

I'm a full-stack developer and UI/UX designer with a passion for building clean, scalable, and user-focused digital experiences. I work across web and mobile platforms using technologies like Python, Flutter, React, Next.js, and Node.js — with back-end systems powered by Firebase, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

As the founder of Cichlify, I lead the development of meaningful tools and platforms — from job boards and e-commerce apps to IP billing systems — focused on solving real problems in business and community spaces. My approach combines strong design principles with efficient code to build products that are both functional and delightful to use.
