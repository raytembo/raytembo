# Hi, I'm Ray  
**Developer • Designer • Problem Solver • Founder @ [Cichlify](https://github.com/cichlify-official)**

I’m a builder at heart, designing and developing digital products that solve real problems and bring ideas to life. My work blends thoughtful design with practical functionality, always aiming for tools that feel intuitive, meaningful, and human.

At Cichlify, the organization I co-founded,and play a role as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO).I lead projects that explore how technology can empower people and communities, whether it’s making it easier to find work, share creativity, or manage everyday business tasks. I care about usability, clarity, and the small details that make a big difference.

I believe innovation isn’t just about new tech, it’s about creating something that actually matters. If that’s your kind of thinking too, I’d love to connect.

Thanks for stopping by.
